## Description

Accessibility is a very important parts of web development. Accessibility on the web is important because it can ensure people who suffer from disabilities can still use and access the website with assisstive technologies. If the website is not coded to be accessible then disabled people will not be able to access the website. It's also one of the most common tasks for front-end and junior developers is to refactor existing code. My job for this project was to do exactly that. I was given the starter code for the Horiseon webpage and improved upon the code with the goal of making it accessible for people with disabilties. One of the ways I did that was by adding semantic elements and alt text to the images, as well as refixing the css codes to reflect those changes made in html. I also added comments to the changes I made in order for people can understand the changes made so others can know how to make a webpage more accessible.
